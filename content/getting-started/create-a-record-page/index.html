<p>
  Now that you've learned how to get a <a href="../start-a-project">Sky app up and running</a>, let's build a page with some content.  There are two common page types in a Sky application, and one of those page types is a record page.  On a record page, information about a specific record is usually displayed in two distinct sections.
</p>

<h2>Summary Section</h2>

<p>
  The first type of section is the summary section.  The summary section resides at the top of the page and provides a general overview of the record,
  such as the record name, a description of the record, perhaps a profile picture, etc.  To add a summary section to your page, use a <code>div</code> with the <code>.bb-page-header</code> CSS class.  Here's an example of a summary section that displays a name, description and profile photo:
</p>

<div class="page-example">
  {{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/summary-section.html" }}
</div>

<pre><code class="language-markup">{{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/summary-section.html" escape=true }}</code></pre>

<h2>Tiles Section</h2>

<p>
  The second type of section is the tile section.  This section usually consists of two columns of tiles (or one column on extra-small screen sizes like on mobile phones) that break out more specific information about the record into logical sections.  Each tile has a header that contains the tile's title and a body that contains the tile's content.  Tiles are collapsible and when used in conjunction with a <a href="../components/tiles">tile dashboard</a> can also be rearranged by the user.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
  This example shows a page with a static tile layout.  To define a dynamic tile layout from a configuration object (such as from user preferences) you can use the <a href="../components/tiles" class="alert-link">tile dashboard directive.</a>
</p>

<div class="page-example">
  {{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/tile-section.html" }}
</div>

<pre><code class="language-markup">{{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/summary-section.html" escape=true }}</code></pre>

<p>
  Tiles can display data in all kinds of formats, whether it's a list of fields and their values, a repeater view of records, a chart, or anything else you can imagine.  We'll get into more detail about the common data elements inside tiles later, but for now let's move on to the next kind of page.
