<h1>{{ name }}</h1>

<div class="bb-text-block">
<p>Now that you've learned how to get a <a href="../start-a-project">{{ stache.config.product_name_short }} app up and running</a>, let's build a page with some content. {{ stache.config.product_name_short }} applications feature two common page types: record pages and tabbed pages.</p>

<p>On record pages, information about specific records is usually displayed in two distinct sections.</p>

<h2>Summary Section</h2>

<p>The first type of section is the summary section. The summary resides at the top of the page and provides a general overview of a record, such as the record name, description, perhaps a profile picture, etc. To add a summary section to your page, use a <code>div</code> with the <code>.bb-page-header</code> CSS class. Here's an example of a summary section that displays a name, description, and profile photo:</p>

<div class="page-example">
  {{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/summary-section.html" }}
</div>

<pre><code class="language-markup">{{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/summary-section.html" escape=true }}</code></pre>

<h2>Tiles Section</h2>

<p>The second type of section is the tile section. This section usually consists of two columns of tiles (or one column for extra-small screen sizes like mobile phones) that break out more specific information about the record into logical sections. Each tile has a header for the tile's title and a body for the tile's content. Tiles are collapsible, and if they used in conjunction with a <a href="../components/tiles">tile dashboard</a>, tiles can also be rearranged by users.</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">This example shows a page with a static tile layout. To define a dynamic tile layout from a configuration object (such as from user preferences) you can use the <a href="../components/tiles" class="alert-link">tile dashboard directive.</a></p>

<div class="page-example">
  {{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/tile-section.html" }}
</div>

<pre><code class="language-markup">{{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/summary-section.html" escape=true }}</code></pre>

<p>Tiles can display data in all kinds of formats, whether it's a list of fields and their values, a repeater view of records, a chart, or anything else you can imagine. You can find into more detail about the common data elements inside tiles in the <strong>Components</strong> section, but for now let's move on to the next kind of page.</p>
