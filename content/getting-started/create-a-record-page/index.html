<h2>Create a Record Page</h2>

<div class="bb-text-block">
<p>
  Now that you've learned how to get a <a href="../start-a-project">Sky app up and running</a>, let's build a page with some content.  There are two common page types in a Sky application, and one of those page types is a record page.  On a record page, information about a specific record is usually displayed in two distinct sections.
</p>

<h3>Summary section</h3>

<p>
  The first type of section is the summary section.  The summary section resides at the top of the page and provides a general overview of the record,
  such as the record name, a description of the record, perhaps a profile picture, etc.  To add a summary section to your page, use a <code>div</code> with the <code>.bb-page-header</code> CSS class.  Here's an example of a summary section that displays a name, description and profile photo:
</p>

<div class="page-example">
  {{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/summary-section.html" }}
</div>

<pre><code class="language-markup">{{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/summary-section.html" escape=true }}</code></pre>

<h3>Tiles section</h3>

<p>
  The second type of section is the tile section.  This section usually consists of two columns of tiles (or one column on extra-small screen sizes like on mobile phones) that break out more specific information about the record into logical sections.  Each tile has a header that contains the tile's title and a body that contains the tile's content.  Tiles are collapsible and when used in conjunction with a <a href="../components/tiles">tile dashboard</a> can also be rearranged by the user.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
  This example shows a page with a static tile layout.  To define a dynamic tile layout from a configuration object (such as from user preferences) you can use the <a href="../components/tiles" class="alert-link">tile dashboard directive.</a>
</p>

<div class="page-example">
  {{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/tile-section.html" }}
</div>

<pre><code class="language-markup">{{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/summary-section.html" escape=true }}</code></pre>

<p>
  Tiles can display data in all kinds of formats, whether it's a list of fields and their values, a repeater view of records, a chart, or anything else you can imagine.  We'll get into more detail about the common data elements inside tiles later, but for now let's move on to the next kind of page.

</div>

<h2>Create a Tabbed Page</h2>

<p>
  In the previous step you learned how to <a href="../create-a-record-page/">create a record page</a>.  In this step you'll learn how to create the other common page type in Sky UX: the tabbed page.  While record pages are used to show data for individual records, a tabbed page usually serves as an overview of many records, such as a list of constituents or gifts.
</p>

<h3>Tabs component</h3>

<p>
  {{ stache.config.product_name_short }} uses the <a href="https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/">UI Bootstrap</a> Tabs module to display tabs and adds more {{ stache.config.product_name_short }}-specific functionality with its own <a href="../components/tabset/">Tabset</a> module.  In this example we have two tabs.  Since each tab represents a list of records, the number of records in each list is displayed next to the tab header with the CSS class <code>.bb-tab-header-count</code>.  Also, since we want the tab content to go edge-to-edge but want the tabs themselves to have a margin, we will need to add the <code>.bb-page-tabs</code> CSS class.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
  This example shows grid data in each tab.  For more information on how to use grids, see the <a href="../components/grid/" class="alert-link">grid directive documentation</a>.
</p>

<div class="page-example" ng-controller="TabbedPageTutorialController as tabbedPage">
  {{ include "includes/create-a-tabbed-page/tabs.html" }}
</div>

<pre><code class="language-markup" ng-non-bindable>{{ include "includes/create-a-tabbed-page/tabs.html" escape=true }}</code></pre>

<p>
  Now that we've covered the two basic page types, let's dive into some more detail about the components of each page.
