<h1>{{ name }}</h1>

<p>After the Getting Started tutorials, you are ready to create your own {{ stache.config.product_name_short }} applications. For more information about the toolset to create applications, see to the {{ stache.config.product_name_short }} reference materials.</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">The current tutorials only cover the basics to get you started, but we will create additional tutorials as we identify areas where they are necessary.</p>

<h2>Reference Materials</h2>

<p>In addition to the Getting Started tutorials, the website features reference materials for {{ stache.config.product_name_short }}'s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework. Currently, the <a href="../../components">Components</a> section describes engineering tools such as directives and services and provides examples and code samples.</p>

<p>We are currently expanding the Components section into a References section that will also describe {{ stache.config.product_name_short }} design patterns and layout elements to provide additional guidance.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Layout section will describe layout elements to build your application such as cards, forms, pages, headers, repeaters, summaries, tabs, and tiles.</li>
<li>The Patterns section will describe the design patterns that create a consisstent user experience. Patterns are key concepts behind {{ stache.config.product_name_short }}'s design philosophy and provide guidance for design decisions and interaction patterns such as how to add, edit, and remove data; error handling; how to display, highlight, and select data; alerts and notifications; navigation; how to search and filter data; styling; and user assistance.</li>
