<p>After you complete the Getting Started tutorials, you can start on your own fully functioning applications. For more information about the toolset to create applications, refer to the {{ stache.config.product_name_short }} reference materials.</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">The current tutorials only cover the basics to get you started, but we will flesh the section out with additional tutorials as we identify the areas where tutorials are necessary.</p>

<h2>Reference Materials</h2>

<p>In addition to the Getting Started tutorials, this website also includes reference materials for {{ stache.config.product_name_short }}'s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework. Currently, the <a href="content/references/components"><strong>Components</strong></a> section describes engineering tools such as directives and services. The <strong>Components</strong></a> section provides examples and code samples for these {{ stache.config.product_name_short }} building blocks.</p>

<p>We are currently expanding the <strong>Components</strong></a> section into a <strong>References</strong> section that will also describes {{ stache.config.product_name_short }} design patterns and layout elements for additional guidance.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>Layout</strong> section will describe layout elements to build your application such as cards, forms, pages, headers, repeaters, summaries, tabs, and tiles.</li>
<li>The <strong>Patterns</strong> section will describe the design patterns that you can employ to create a consisstent user experience with {{ stache.config.product_name_short }}. Patterns are key concepts behind the design philosophy and provide guidance for design decisions and interaction patterns such as how to add data, alerts and notifications, how to edit data, error handling, filters, highlights, labels, navigation, how to display data, how to remove data, how to search and filter data, options to select data, styling, toasts, and user assistance.</li>
