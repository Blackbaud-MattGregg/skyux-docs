<h2>Reference Materials</h2>

<p>In addition to the Getting Started tutorials, the website also includes reference materials for {{ stache.config.product_name_short }}'s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework. Currently, the <a href="content/references/components"><strong>Components</strong></a> section describes engineering tools such as directives and services that developers can implement to create a consistent user experience. The <strong>Components</strong></a> section provides examples and code samples for the components that are the building blocks for your applications.</p>

<p>We are currently expanding the <strong>Components</strong></a> section into a more complete <strong>References</strong> section that also describes {{ stache.config.product_name_short }} patterns and layout elements to provide additional guidance for creating customizations.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>Patterns</strong> section will describe the user experience patterns that are building blocks for design elements. Patterns are key concepts behind {{ stache.config.product_name_short }}'s design philosophy that provide guidance for visual design and interaction patterns. This section will describe patterns such as how to add data, alerts and notifications, how to edit data, error handling, filters, highlights, labels, navigation, how to display data, how to remove data, how to search and filter data, options to select data, styling, toasts, and user assistance.</li>
