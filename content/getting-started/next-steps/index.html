<p>After you complete the Getting Started tutorials, you are ready to start your own {{ stache.config.product_name_short }} applications. For more information about the toolset to create applications, you can refer to the {{ stache.config.product_name_short }} reference materials.</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">The current tutorials only cover the basics to get you started, but we will flesh out the section as we identify other areas where tutorials are necessary.</p>

<h2>Reference Materials</h2>

<p>In addition to the Getting Started tutorials, this website includes reference materials for {{ stache.config.product_name_short }}'s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework. Currently, the <a href="../../components">Components</a> section describes engineering tools such as directives and services. The Components section provides examples and code samples for {{ stache.config.product_name_short }}'s building blocks.</p>

<p>We are currently expanding the Components section into a References section that will also describes {{ stache.config.product_name_short }} design patterns and layout elements to provide additional guidance.</p>
