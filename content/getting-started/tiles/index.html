    <p>
    <a href="../../components/tile">Tiles</a> serve as containers for information related to the parent record of the page. The specific functionality and content of a tile will depend on the information being presented. 
    </p>
    <div class="page-example"><img src="/assets/img/patterns/tile base.png" /></div>
    <h2>1. Tile name</h2>
    <p>
    The name used to identify the tile should be chosen so that it is understandable to the user and uniquely identifies the tile.
    </p>
    <h2>2. Tile actions</h2>
    <p>
    At minimum, tiles can be collapsed and moved. Some tile content will additionally be configurable, although ideally the design will predict the user's needs and avoid the need for configuration.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Record actions</h2>
    <p>
    Some tile content will have actions related to the presented information. The most common case for this will be adding child records of the type presented in the tile - e.g. adding a new Note from a tile showing a list of Notes pertaining to the parent record.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Filters</h2>
    <p>
    It will sometimes be useful for the user to be able to filter the content of a tile. The <a href="../../patterns/filtering">type of filtering</a> used will depend on the complexity of needed filters. 
    </p>
    <h2>5. Key information</h2>
    <p>
    There will often be key information that can be extracted from the content presented in the tile. <a href="../../components/text-styling">Calling out this information</a> will make the page more digestible by lessening the need for the user to do analysis on the presented data. This is particularly common for numeric data.
    </p>
    <h2>6. Arbitrary content</h2>
    <p>
    The content you put in the tile should support the tasks of the user visiting the page and account for the context in which the information will be used. While it is tempting to overload tiles with a lot of content, doing so makes the page harder to parse and can hinder the task the user is trying to complete. Where possible the information should be abstracted to a level that is easily understandable, rather than dumping raw data into the tile and requiring the user to do their own analysis. 
    </p>
    <p>
    While the content in a tile is arbitrary, there are a few common layouts and presentation methods. If more than one type of information needs to be presented the tile can be divided into sections.
    </p>
    <h3>Graph</h3>
    <p>
    When presenting numeric information it is often more useful to present it in a graphical format rather than as raw numbers. As with the key information described above, providing the user with synthesized data makes the content easier to make use of. It is important that the <a href="../../patterns/graphs">type of graph</a> used is chosen to support the specific task you are designing for, as it is generally possible to present the same data in multiple ways. 
    </p>
    <h3>List</h3>
    <p>
    By using a <a href="../../components/repeater">repeater</a> you can create lists that fill a similar role to grids but can be better laid out to show an information hierarchy that highlights more important information. There is another benefit of well-designed lists when scaling down to phones - the presentation will remain useful in all form factors, where grids do not scale down well.
    </p>
    <h3>Two-column</h3>
    <p>
        When showing straightforward data like contact information, a simple <a href="../../components/two-column">two-column</a> Label/Value layout is frequently sufficient. If more than one type of data needs to be presented on a single tile you can use multiple instances of a two-column layout distinguished by section headers. 
    </p>
    <h3>Grid</h3>
    <p>
    The <a href="../../components/grid">grid</a> is an extremely common presentation method and can be useful when data needs to be sorted or visually scanned to look for outliers. However, they tend to be overused as a default presentation - their density requires the user to invest significant cognitive effort for sensemaking. Before using a grid take a step back and analyze whether a different presentation could better support the specific task at hand.
    </p>
    <h3>Bespoke</h3>
    <p>
    If none of the above layouts suit the needs of the task you are supporting you can create your own custom design. A word of caution, though, that it is easy to end up with a non-cohesive experience when multiple custom tiles are used on a page. It's strongly suggested that you use one of the standard presentations except when absolutely necessary.
