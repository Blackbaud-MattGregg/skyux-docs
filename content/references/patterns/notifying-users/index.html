    <p>
    The method of notifying a user of an important message will differ based on the context and content of the message.
    </p>
    <h2>Alerts</h2>
    <p>
    If a user needs to be made aware of a message related to a particular page when they view that page but not when they are elsewhere in the system, use an <a href="../../../components/alert">alert</a> at the top of that page. 
    </p>
    <h2>Labels</h2>
    <p>
    If you need to communicate status of a record and status is an important aspect of the information, use a <a href="../../../components/label">label</a>. The styling is bold enough to catch the eye without being overly distracting. In general labels should communicate binary information or values from a small, system-defined list. It’s important when using labels to evaluate whether the information is important enough to warrant the bold treatment – if there are too many labels on the page they become distracting and lose their attention-grabbing power. 
    </p>
    <h2>Text Styling</h2>
    <p>
    When communicating status where status is not the most important aspect of the information, use <a href="../../../components/text-styling">text styling</a>. This will avoid distracting the user from other important information. 
    </p>
    <h2>Toasts</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="../../../components/toast">Toasts</a> are used to communicate messages triggered by background processes. This may include processes that the user initiates which run in the background instead of on the page, or system processes that the user needs to be aware of. Depending on the nature of the message in the toast you may specify it to automatically fade after a set amount of time or require the user to click the toast to dismiss it.
