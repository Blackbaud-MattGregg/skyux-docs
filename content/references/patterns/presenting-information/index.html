    As it is not feasible to convey all there is to know about visual and information design, here is the primary mantra as we see it:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    Don’t assume that data leads to knowledge or that knowledge leads to action.
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Text</h2>
    <p>
    In many cases a large dataset can be boiled down to a few key pieces of summarized information. <a href="">Highlighting this information</a> gives the user a good idea of what the data says with minimal effort.  
    </p>
    <h2>Grids</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="">Grids</a> are a popular way to display information, and tend to be the default way to present large amounts of information. Ensure that when you are using a grid that it is the best tool for the job. They tend to require a lot of effort to analyze and interpret, and there may be a better approach that gets at the need (because seeing raw data is rarely the actual need).
    </p>
    <h2>Graphs</h2>
    <p>
    Everyone loves graphs. They are a great way to condense a lot of data into a small amount of space. They sell well. They provide visual interest. They are fun to design. But they also need to be used with care. It’s very easy to get too fancy and present information in a way that clouds what is happening.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are a handful of common types of graphs that can be used to address the majority of needs.
