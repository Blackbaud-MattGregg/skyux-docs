<div class="bb-text-block">
    <p>There are four levels of complexity we support for filtering. Use the approach that best fits the scenario for which you are designing.</p>
    <h2>1-3 fields, frequently needed</h2>
    <p>
    In cases where there are a small number of fields on which to filter and the user will frequently need to change those filters, use an <a href="../../../references/components/filter">inline always-visible filter</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>1-3 fields, infrequently needed</h2>
    <p>
    In cases where there are a small number of fields on which to filter but the need to change those filters will be infrequent, use an <a href="../../../references/components/filter">inline user-invoked filter</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>4+ fields, can be grouped together</h2>
    <p>
    In cases where there are a moderate number of fields on which to filter but the number is small enough that the user can easily understand them if they are on one form, use a <a href="../../../references/components/filter">modal single-page filter</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>4+ fields, need to be grouped into separate categories</h2>
    <p>
    In cases where there are a large number of fields on which to filter and the usability of the form will be helped by breaking those fields up into related groups, use a <a href="../../../references/components/filter">modal categorized filter</a>.
    </p>
