    There will be situations where it’s not obvious to a user how they should proceed to accomplish their task. There are a variety of ways to support them by providing guidance, answering questions and suggesting best practices.
    </p>
    <h2>Persistent text</h2>
    <p>
    Sometimes a sentence or two of explanation can help users understand the task they are about to perform. This can be especially helpful if the impact of the user’s decisions will have a system-wide impact that might not be obvious from the controls in the immediate task the user is performing. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Limit this text to a sentence, perhaps two at the most. A wall of text is almost always going to be ignored. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Blocks of text can become cluttering on screens that will see heavy traffic. If you’re designing a screen that is going to be seen a lot, consider another approach. Over time, that text will have minimal value but will still be taking up screen space. To help avoid visual clutter use <a href="">text styling</a> to de-emphasize the text. 
    </p>
    <h2>Help callout</h2>
    <p>
    It should be fairly rare to need persistent text explanations on the screen. For cases where explanatory text will be useful the first couple of times a user does a task but the ramifications of a mistake are small you can use a <a href="">popover</a> containing explanatory text. This will allow the user access to the assistance when needed but avoid most of the visual clutter associated with the text.  
    </p>
    <h2>System help</h2>
    <p>
    The <a href="">help service is available to provide comprehensive guidance about how to use a set of functionality. This can be accessed in the omnibar or from <a href="">help buttons</a> placed within the page.
