    <h2>Top Level</h2>
    <p>
    Pages accessed in <a href="../../../references/components/navbar/">top-level navigation</a> should support one or a set of tasks the user needs to complete. Once the user navigates to one of these top-level pages they should be able to complete those tasks without having to use top-level navigation again.  
    </p>
    <h2>Contextual</h2>
    <p>
    Since one of our primary goals is for the user to experience a smooth workflow the bulk of the navigating a user performs should be contextual, within the task they are trying to complete. Well-designed functionality will predict the types of related information a user will need to see and provide a way to access that information from within their workflow.
