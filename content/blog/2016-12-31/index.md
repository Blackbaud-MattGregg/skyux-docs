Design-oriented updates in SkyUX versions 1.10.2-1.12.0

<!-- more -->

## Recently completed

### [Listbuilder](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/listbuilder/)

The Grid view is now available as a layout option with Listbuilder.

We also added a secondary action button in the toolbar to provide access actions beyond what is provided by default.

## In the works

The team is now focusing on porting components over to [SkyUX 2](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2).

## Completed designs

### [Color scheme](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux/issues/944)

We are going to be making some color changes to improve accessibility and consistency. In general the changes aren’t major, but they will break visual regression tests. A side benefit of this change is that it will allow us to improve our color documentation, which has been a common piece of feedback we’ve received.
